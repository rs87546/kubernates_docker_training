# Kubernetes July 2025

<pre>
- Out of these 3 servers, which one you should connect to?
- You would have received, the cloud login credentials from your L&D focal point
- as per your cloud user last 2 digits, 
  you can find the exact linux user and the respective server alloted to you
- For example
  - if your cloud user ends with let's say 17, your linux username is user17, 
  hence you should connect to server2
  - if your cloud user ends with let's say 03, your linux username is user03,
  hence you should connect to server1

  - kindly ensure you are not using the demo link while connecting to your lab machine
